# chess-winner-predection
This project focuses on predicting the outcome of chess matches based on player statistics and historical game data using machine learning models. The goal is to classify whether a player will win, lose, or draw based on features like player ratings, turns, time controls, and more.
# ♟️ Chess Match Outcome Prediction

This project is focused on predicting the outcome of chess matches (win, loss, or draw) using machine learning models trained on historical chess data.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to analyze key game features—such as player ratings, number of turns, and opening strategies—and use this information to build a predictive model for match outcomes. This project was built as part of my internship learning journey at **Ausweg Info Controls**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature selection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution analysis  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Feature impact on target

3. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors  
   - Model tuning and cross-validation

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report

## 📈 Results

- Achieved reliable prediction accuracy on unseen test data  
- Insights on how rating differences, turns, and openings influence match outcomes  
- Built a test interface to input new data and get prediction results

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
1. Clone this repo
2. Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see predictions
